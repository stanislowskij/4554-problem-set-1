# Problem 3 (4 points)

Exercise 1.5 on p. 25.

---

**1.5.** As we learned in this chapter, modular arithmetic is the basis of many cryptosystems. As a consequence, we will address this topic with several problems in this and upcoming chapters.
Let’s start with an easy one: Compute the result without a calculator.
1. 15 · 29 mod 13
2. 2 · 29 mod 13
3. 2 · 3 mod 13
4. −11 · 3 mod 13

### Solution

1. 
```  
  15*29 mod 13 
≡ 3*3   mod 13 
≡ 9     mod 13.
```
2. 
```
  2*29 mod 13
≡ 2*3  mod 13
≡ 6    mod 13.
```
3.
```
  2*3 mod 13
≡ 6   mod 13.
```
4. 
```
  -11*3 mod 13
≡ 2*3   mod 13
≡ 6     mod 13.
```
